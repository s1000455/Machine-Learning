## What is machine learning?

&emsp; A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

## Machine Learning is great for:
* Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.  
* Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning  techniques can find a solution.  
* Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
* Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.  

## Types of Machine Learning Systems  
* Supervised Learning:  
&emsp; A typical supervised learning task are classification and regression.  
    * Some Algorithms:  
        * K-Nearest Neighbors  
        * Regression  
        * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)  
        * Decision Trees and Random Forests  
        * Neural networks (Note that some neural network architectures can be unsupervised or semisupervised.)  
* Unsupervised Learning:
    * Clustering  
        * k-Means  
        * Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)  
        * Expextation Maximization  
    * Visualization and dimensionality reduction  
        * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
        * Kernel PCA  
        * Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)  
        * t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
